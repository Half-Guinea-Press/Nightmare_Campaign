Feat: Flexible Weapon Master
You've become an expert in the use of rope darts and meteor hammers, granting you the following benefits while wielding a weapon of these types.
You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with the weapon. When you attempt to grapple a creature, you can substitute a Strength (Athletics) check with an attack roll from this weapon. However, you must still use a Strength (Athletics) check to maintain the grapple if the creature attempts to break free.
As a bonus action on your turn, you can attempt to dazzle an enemy with your weapon. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Charisma (Performance) check, contested by an enemy's Wisdom (Insight) check. If you win the contest, you gain advantage on weapon attack rolls you make against that target until the end of your turn. Once you've used this feature against a creature, you can't use it against the same creature again until you complete a long rest.
Magical Weapons
This section details some options for magical versions of rope darts and meteor hammers to add to your game should you incorporate these weapons.
Windsong
Weapon (rope dart), uncommon (requires attunement) The dart head of this weapon is made of thin stone, with several holes in it to reduce its weight. When it is used in combat, wind traveling through the holes seems to almost create whistling music, that increases in pitch and fervor with each subsequent attack.
While attuned to this weapon, you know the Shillelagh cantrip, and this weapon is a valid target for the spell. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this cantrip.
Sun & Fang
Weapon (meteor hammer), uncommon This weapon has a head on each end; a meteor hammer on one end, and a rope dart on the other. Though it is difficult, they can be used in conjunction with one another.
After you take the Attack action with this weapon, you can use a bonus action to make an attack with the other end. This attack deals 1d4 piercing damage instead of the weapon's normal damage.
Seeking Hammer
Weapon (meteor hammer), rare (requires attunement) This sleek-looking hammer is outfitted with arcane repulsors along its surface that can guide it towards its targets. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. This weapon has five charges, and regains 1d4+1 charges each dawn. When you make an attack roll, you can expend charges to increase the reach of this weapon by 5 feet per charge spent. When you do so, your attack also ignores cover.
Dusk & Dawn
Weapon (rope dart), very rare (requires attunement by a creature of any Neutral alignment)
This double-ended weapon sports a bright gold dart head on one end, and an obsidian hammer head on the other. It is said that any who are able to wield the weapon have the potential to obtain true inner balance.
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls made with this weapon, and this weapon deals an additional 1d8 radiant damage on a hit. When you take the attack action with this weapon, you can make a single attack with it as a bonus action, which deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage and 1d8 necrotic damage instead of the weapon's normal damage.
Watchdog's Bite
Weapon (meteor hammer), very rare (requires attunement) The head of this hammer is intricately carved in the shape of a hound's head. It resembles a hound of myth that once stood watch over the land of the dead.
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. When you hit an Undead creature with an attack from this weapon, the attack deals an additional 2d8 force damage, and the creature's movement speed is reduced by half until the end of their next turn.
Blazing Sting
Weapon (rope dart), legendary (requires attunement by a creature of any non-good alignment)
Supposedly once used by a warrior who had mastery of the flames of hell, this rope dart has an unsettling appearance and is hot to the touch.
You gain the following benefits while attuned to this magical weapon:
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
As a bonus action, you can imbue this weapon with hellfire. For the next minute or until you dismiss this effect, your attacks deal an additional 2d6 fire damage. Once you've used this feature you can't do so again until the next dawn.
Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack roll from this weapon, you can speak a command phrase to pull the creature into any empty space within 5 feet of you.
Wyrmhammer
Weapon (meteor hammer), artifact (requires attunement) This weapon exudes a powerful draconic aura. The dungeon master decides the weapon's elemental damage type when the weapon is added to the game world: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. You gain the following benefits when attuned to this magical weapon:
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
You learn the Draconic language if you do not already know it, and you have advantage on Charisma checks against any creatures of the Dragon type.
The first time you hit with an attack with this weapon each turn, you deal an additional 3d6 damage of its elemental damage type.
When you roll a 20 on the die for an attack roll made with this weapon, each creature of your choice within 60 feet of you must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become Frightened of you for one minute. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success.
Sentience. The Wyrmhammer is a sentient weapon, with mental statistics determined by your dungeon master when the weapon is generated. It can communicate telepathically in Draconic to any creature who touches the weapon.
Curse. The Wyrmhammer is actually a prison for an ancient chromatic dragon, whose type is determined by the weapon's elemental damage type. If at any time a creature ends their attunement to this item, the dragon is released from its confinement and appears in an empty space within 5 feet of the weapon. The dragon is hostile to the creature who was attuned to this item, and they and their allies have disadvantage on Charisma checks made to dissuade it from violence.
