# Alchemist

As smoke clears from a candle-lit laboratory, a gnome wipes the soot from his goggles. In front of him lies a glowing mixture that fumes offensively after the sudden, but anticipated, reaction. His excitement overcomes a curse the concoction seems to be casting on his senses, as he rushes to seal the now-shaking flask with cork. Holding the vibrating flask in hand, he smiles as he drips a layer of resin over the cork, proudly preparing his bottle of bad day for the trip ahead.

Often found cooped-up with their experiments or scavenging the wilds for ingredients, the alchemist is a student of the metaphysical essence of things, and is as curious as they are resourceful. They may be dedicated to the research of medicinal applications, demolitionists fascinated with the kinetic potential of violent reactions, or researchers of the hidden weakness of monsters that plague the land.

Alchemy and Magic

The chemical creations of an alchemist can often blur the line between the natural and supernatural. Considering spells often draw on power through material components, it’s entirely reasonable to believe an alchemist exists somewhere in this blur, but unless the creation specifically makes mention of a spell, the item and its effects are not themselves magical. Alchemists are a great fit for low-magic campaigns, where spellcasting may be extremely rare for the standard adventurer.

Playing an Alchemist

This class grants you features intended for a particular playstyle. The alchemist is a low defense, high damage and utility martial blaster. It’s highly recommended that, in combat, you stay a safe distance away from the enemies to use your alchemical items on them, but as far back as is safe.

Action: Use an Object

Bonus Action (Set-Up): Catalyze

Movement: Maintain distance from the enemy but stay within range to attack with items. Salbenists are likely feeling safer in the mid-to-frontline.

Reaction: Some class features, or trigger for Ready action.

Creating an Alchemist

To create an alchemist, consult the following subsections, which give you hit points, proficiencies, and starting equipment. Then look at the Alchemist table to see which features you get at each level. Your Proficiency Bonus is shown in the PB column. The descriptions of those features appear in the “Class Features” section.

Quick Build

You can make an alchemist quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose the guild artisan background.

Hit Points

Hit Dice: 1d8 per alchemist level

Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier

Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per level above 1st

Proficiencies

Armor: Light armor

Weapons: Simple weapons, blowguns

Tools: Alchemist’s supplies, herbalism kit

Saving Throws: Constitution, Intelligence

Skills: Choose two from Arcana, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Sleight of Hand, Survival

Starting Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

• Two alchemical items that you know the formula for and 25 gp worth of raw materials

• (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon

• (a) a demolitioner’s pack, (b) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (c) a mediciner’s pack

• Leather armor, a dagger, 5 flasks, and alchemist’s supplies

If you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the items offered by your background, you start with 5d4 × 10 gp to buy your equipment.

Multiclassing and the Alchemist

If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose alchemist as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum. As a multiclass character, you must have at least an Intelligence score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already an alchemist.

Proficiencies Gained. If alchemist isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as an alchemist: simple weapons, blowguns, alchemist’s supplies, and herbalism kits.

Class Features

As an alchemist, you gain the following class features, which are summarized in the Alchemist table.

Experimentalist Adept

1st-Level Alchemist Feature

Choose one of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses alchemist’s supplies and the chosen proficiency.

Additionally, you only need to provide 5 gp worth of raw materials to craft any alchemical item you know the formula for worth 50 gp or less. When you craft alchemical items during a long rest, the maximum number of alchemical items you can create during the long rest is equal to your alchemist level + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).1

1 This enhances a crafting rule in Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 79, which has also been reprinted here in the Equipment chapter under alchemist's supplies.

Alchemy

1st-Level Alchemist Feature

Your practice of alchemical research has trained you in the implementation and creation of devastating chemical concoctions of incredible power. See the Alchemical Items section at the end of this class for the effects and items you can create with this feature.

Formulae

You know the formula for basic acid, alchemist’s fire, antitoxin, basic oil, perfume, soap, and two other alchemical items of your choice. Each time you gain an alchemist level, you learn the formula for another alchemical item of your choice. You might find and discover other formulae during your adventures.2

You could find the formula for a tanglefoot bag sold by a potion seller in a market, for example, or shuffled among the notes of an elder alchemist’s laboratory. Alternatively, if you find a potion or alchemical item, you can research its components to learn its formula. The process of learning a formula takes 2 hours experimenting with your alchemist’s supplies. If you experimented on an alchemical item or potion to do so, the item is destroyed in this process. If the item has a rarity of common, the time required is doubled, and doubles again for each rank of rarity above common.

Catalyze

As a bonus action on your turn, you can quickly create an alchemical item. To use this ability, you must have your hands free and the raw materials and container required in your inventory.3

Raw materials you use with this feature are consumed by the process, and any item you create with this bonus action loses its potency if not used within 1 minute.4

Potency

You have trained in the use of alchemical items in combat, granting you the following benefits:

• The range you can throw any alchemical item is doubled, and being within 5 feet of the target of a ranged attack you make with an alchemical item does not impose disadvantage on the attack roll.

• You can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, when making an attack roll with alchemical items. If the item calls for a saving throw, you can use your alchemy save DC instead of the DC listed in the item’s description, as shown below:

Alchemy save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Alchemical Practice

2nd-Level Alchemist Feature

You choose your Alchemical Practice, a subclass which grants you features at 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

2 This operates on the assumption that your table uses the sidebar rule "Magic Item Formulas" in the Dungeon Masters Guide, p. 141.

3 The cost of raw materials is reduced by Experimentalist Adept.

4 Alchemical items that you craft as a downtime activity are assumed to be crafted with patience and care in a controlled environment. However, those that you create with Catalyze are made swiftly and lack stability.

Eureka

3rd-Level Alchemist Feature

You can use the bonus action granted by Catalyze to create a potion with a rarity of common that you know the formula for, providing required raw materials. The potion lasts for the same duration as any alchemical item you create with Catalyze. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest. The rarity of the potion you can create increases as you gain levels in this class, starting at 9th level (uncommon) and again at 13th level (rare).

Methodical Efficiency

3rd-Level Alchemist Feature

You can use a bonus action on your turn to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check or take the Use an Object action. Further, when you draw an item from your inventory during your free interaction on your turn, you can draw or store two items, rather than one.

Ability Score Improvement

4th-Level Alchemist Feature

When you reach 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Dulcified Decoctions

5th-Level Alchemist Feature

Any items you create through the bonus action granted by Catalyze now last for 10 minutes before losing their potency.

Mix

7th-Level Alchemist Feature

While you have two alchemical items or potions in hand and neither is the same item, you can use the bonus action granted by Catalyze to swiftly, and safely, combine them.5

When the new combined item is used, both effects occur simultaneously. The combined item loses its potency if it is not used within 10 minutes, and attempting to use this feature with a previously combined item results in both of the items losing their potency.

Mercurial Flux

9th-Level Alchemist Feature

When you create an alchemical item, you can replace the raw materials required with valuables (such as gold pieces) of a value equivalent to or greater than the cost of the raw materials.

Volatile Potency

11th-Level Alchemist Feature

When a damage or healing roll is made with an alchemical item or potion you created, you can roll one additional die of 5 If your table uses the Mixing Potions variant rule from the Dungeon Master's Guide, the term "safely" has been used in this feature to indicate that you do this in a way that does not subject the potion to this variant rule. the same size and add it to the damage or healing of the item.

If the item uses multiple damage dice sizes, the die you roll an additional time is the largest size used. You can roll a second additional die with this feature when you reach 17th level.

Mind Over Matter

13th-Level Alchemist Feature

You can apply your quick wit and analysis to any situation. When you make a Strength or Dexterity ability check or saving throw, you can use your reaction to give yourself a bonus to the roll equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1). Whenever you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

Philosopher’s Stone

15th-Level Alchemist Feature

Your studies have revealed to you the mystic formula for the legendary philosopher’s stone, which you can create over the course of 7 days. If you create a new philosopher’s stone while one you have created already exists, the previous stone is destroyed and returns to nothing. Your philosopher’s stone grants you the following benefits:

• While you are within 1 mile of your philosopher’s stone, you are immune to disease and cannot be aged by natural or magical means.

• You can use the Use an Object action to manifest a nonmagical item that can fit in your hand that has a value of 50 gp or less. Once you use this action, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

• You can allow the philosopher’s stone to replace any of the material components called for by a spell. If you do, the stone is consumed by the spell.

Lightning in a Bottle

18th-Level Alchemist Feature

When you create a potion with your Eureka feature, you can create a potion with a rarity of very rare. Once you create a very rare potion this way, you can’t do so again for 7 days.

Big Bang

20th-Level Alchemist Feature

When you roll for initiative, you can use the Use an Object action once (no action required). Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
