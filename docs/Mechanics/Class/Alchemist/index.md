# Alchemist
As smoke clears from a candle-lit laboratory, a gnome wipes the soot from his goggles. In front of him lies a glowing mixture that fumes offensively after the sudden, but anticipated, reaction. His excitement overcomes a curse the concoction seems to be casting on his senses, as he rushes to seal the now-shaking flask with cork. Holding the vibrating flask in hand, he smiles as he drips a layer of resin over the cork, proudly preparing his bottle of bad day for the trip ahead.
Often found cooped-up with their experiments or scavenging the wilds for ingredients, the alchemist is a student of the metaphysical essence of things, and is as curious as they are resourceful. They may be dedicated to the research of medicinal applications, demolitionists fascinated with the kinetic potential of violent reactions, or researchers of the hidden weakness of monsters that plague the land.
Alchemy and Magic
The chemical creations of an alchemist can often blur the line between the natural and supernatural. Considering spells often draw on power through material components, it’s entirely reasonable to believe an alchemist exists somewhere in this blur, but unless the creation specifically makes mention of a spell, the item and its effects are not themselves magical. Alchemists are a great fit for low-magic campaigns, where spellcasting may be extremely rare for the standard adventurer.
Playing an Alchemist
This class grants you features intended for a particular playstyle. The alchemist is a low defense, high damage and utility martial blaster. It’s highly recommended that, in combat, you stay a safe distance away from the enemies to use your alchemical items on them, but as far back as is safe.
Action: Use an Object
Bonus Action (Set-Up): Catalyze
Movement: Maintain distance from the enemy but stay within range to attack with items. Salbenists are likely feeling safer in the mid-to-frontline.
Reaction: Some class features, or trigger for Ready action.
Creating an Alchemist
To create an alchemist, consult the following subsections, which give you hit points, proficiencies, and starting equipment. Then look at the Alchemist table to see which features you get at each level. Your Proficiency Bonus is shown in the PB column. The descriptions of those features appear in the “Class Features” section.
Quick Build
You can make an alchemist quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose the guild artisan background.
Hit Points
Hit Dice: 1d8 per alchemist level
Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier
Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per level above 1st
Proficiencies
Armor: Light armor
Weapons: Simple weapons, blowguns
Tools: Alchemist’s supplies, herbalism kit
Saving Throws: Constitution, Intelligence
Skills: Choose two from Arcana, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Sleight of Hand, Survival
Starting Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
• Two alchemical items that you know the formula for and 25 gp worth of raw materials
• (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon
• (a) a demolitioner’s pack, (b) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (c) a mediciner’s pack
• Leather armor, a dagger, 5 flasks, and alchemist’s supplies
If you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the items offered by your background, you start with 5d4 × 10 gp to buy your equipment.
Multiclassing and the Alchemist
If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose alchemist as one of your classes.
Ability Score Minimum. As a multiclass character, you must have at least an Intelligence score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already an alchemist.
Proficiencies Gained. If alchemist isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as an alchemist: simple weapons, blowguns, alchemist’s supplies, and herbalism kits.

Class Features
As an alchemist, you gain the following class features, which are summarized in the Alchemist table.
Experimentalist Adept
1st-Level Alchemist Feature
Choose one of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses alchemist’s supplies and the chosen proficiency.
Additionally, you only need to provide 5 gp worth of raw materials to craft any alchemical item you know the formula for worth 50 gp or less. When you craft alchemical items during a long rest, the maximum number of alchemical items you can create during the long rest is equal to your alchemist level + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).1
1 This enhances a crafting rule in Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 79, which has also been reprinted here in the Equipment chapter under alchemist's supplies.
Alchemy
1st-Level Alchemist Feature
Your practice of alchemical research has trained you in the implementation and creation of devastating chemical concoctions of incredible power. See the Alchemical Items section at the end of this class for the effects and items you can create with this feature.
Formulae
You know the formula for basic acid, alchemist’s fire, antitoxin, basic oil, perfume, soap, and two other alchemical items of your choice. Each time you gain an alchemist level, you learn the formula for another alchemical item of your choice. You might find and discover other formulae during your adventures.2
 You could find the formula for a tanglefoot bag sold by a potion seller in a market, for example, or shuffled among the notes of an elder alchemist’s laboratory. Alternatively, if you find a potion or alchemical item, you can research its components to learn its formula. The process of learning a formula takes 2 hours experimenting with your alchemist’s supplies. If you experimented on an alchemical item or potion to do so, the item is destroyed in this process. If the item has a rarity of common, the time required is doubled, and doubles again for each rank of rarity above common.
Catalyze
As a bonus action on your turn, you can quickly create an alchemical item. To use this ability, you must have your hands free and the raw materials and container required in your inventory.3
 Raw materials you use with this feature are consumed by the process, and any item you create with this bonus action loses its potency if not used within 1 minute.4
Potency
You have trained in the use of alchemical items in combat, granting you the following benefits:
• The range you can throw any alchemical item is doubled, and being within 5 feet of the target of a ranged attack you make with an alchemical item does not impose disadvantage on the attack roll.
• You can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, when making an attack roll with alchemical items. If the item calls for a saving throw, you can use your alchemy save DC instead of the DC listed in the item’s description, as shown below:
Alchemy save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
Alchemical Practice
2nd-Level Alchemist Feature
You choose your Alchemical Practice, a subclass which grants you features at 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.
2 This operates on the assumption that your table uses the sidebar rule "Magic Item Formulas" in the Dungeon Masters Guide, p. 141.
3 The cost of raw materials is reduced by Experimentalist Adept.
4 Alchemical items that you craft as a downtime activity are assumed to be crafted with patience and care in a controlled environment. However, those that you create with Catalyze are made swiftly and lack stability.
Eureka
3rd-Level Alchemist Feature
You can use the bonus action granted by Catalyze to create a potion with a rarity of common that you know the formula for, providing required raw materials. The potion lasts for the same duration as any alchemical item you create with Catalyze. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest. The rarity of the potion you can create increases as you gain levels in this class, starting at 9th level (uncommon) and again at 13th level (rare).
Methodical Efficiency
3rd-Level Alchemist Feature
You can use a bonus action on your turn to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check or take the Use an Object action. Further, when you draw an item from your inventory during your free interaction on your turn, you can draw or store two items, rather than one.
Ability Score Improvement
4th-Level Alchemist Feature
When you reach 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
Dulcified Decoctions
5th-Level Alchemist Feature
Any items you create through the bonus action granted by Catalyze now last for 10 minutes before losing their potency.
Mix
7th-Level Alchemist Feature
While you have two alchemical items or potions in hand and neither is the same item, you can use the bonus action granted by Catalyze to swiftly, and safely, combine them.5
 When the new combined item is used, both effects occur simultaneously. The combined item loses its potency if it is not used within 10 minutes, and attempting to use this feature with a previously combined item results in both of the items losing their potency.
Mercurial Flux
9th-Level Alchemist Feature
When you create an alchemical item, you can replace the raw materials required with valuables (such as gold pieces) of a value equivalent to or greater than the cost of the raw materials.
Volatile Potency
11th-Level Alchemist Feature
When a damage or healing roll is made with an alchemical item or potion you created, you can roll one additional die of 5 If your table uses the Mixing Potions variant rule from the Dungeon Master's Guide, the term "safely" has been used in this feature to indicate that you do this in a way that does not subject the potion to this variant rule. the same size and add it to the damage or healing of the item.
If the item uses multiple damage dice sizes, the die you roll an additional time is the largest size used. You can roll a second additional die with this feature when you reach 17th level.
Mind Over Matter
13th-Level Alchemist Feature
You can apply your quick wit and analysis to any situation. When you make a Strength or Dexterity ability check or saving throw, you can use your reaction to give yourself a bonus to the roll equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1). Whenever you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
Philosopher’s Stone
15th-Level Alchemist Feature
Your studies have revealed to you the mystic formula for the legendary philosopher’s stone, which you can create over the course of 7 days. If you create a new philosopher’s stone while one you have created already exists, the previous stone is destroyed and returns to nothing. Your philosopher’s stone grants you the following benefits:
• While you are within 1 mile of your philosopher’s stone, you are immune to disease and cannot be aged by natural or magical means.
• You can use the Use an Object action to manifest a nonmagical item that can fit in your hand that has a value of 50 gp or less. Once you use this action, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.
• You can allow the philosopher’s stone to replace any of the material components called for by a spell. If you do, the stone is consumed by the spell.
Lightning in a Bottle
18th-Level Alchemist Feature
When you create a potion with your Eureka feature, you can create a potion with a rarity of very rare. Once you create a very rare potion this way, you can’t do so again for 7 days.
Big Bang
20th-Level Alchemist Feature
When you roll for initiative, you can use the Use an Object action once (no action required). Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
Alchemical Practices
Alchemists dedicate themselves to a Practice, a specialization that describes their passion for alchemy. The following practice options are available for you to choose from at 2nd level.
Animator
Stirring from the theories of a primordial soup that spawned all life as we know it, Animators are alchemists seeking to synthesize life. They are creators of alchemical constructs, known as homunculus, that are often found with the animator serving as an assistant in their research.
Animator Features
Alchemist
Level Feature
2nd Homunculus Companion, Zoetic Theory
6th Anima Profane

14th Contemptible Chimera
Homunculus Companion
2nd-Level Animator Feature
You can conduct a ritual over the course of an hour, shaping a mixture of 25 gp worth of clay, ash, mandrake root, and blood. After the ritual, you gain the service of a homunculus. Your homunculus is a faithful companion, and it dies if you die. You determine the homunculus’s appearance. See this creature’s game statistics in the Alchemical Homunculus stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.
In combat, the homunculus shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The homunculus is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your telepathic commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger. If you are incapacitated, the homunculus can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.
You can’t have more than one homunculus at a time. If you attempt to create another while you have a homunculus, the creation fails.

Evasion. If the homunculus is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails. It can’t use this trait if it’s incapacitated.
Telepathic Bond. While the homunculus is on the same plane of existence as you, it can magically convey what it senses to you, and you can communicate telepathically with each other.
Actions
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +2 plus PB to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your alchemy save DC or be poisoned for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target falls unconscious, or until it takes damage or another creature uses an action to shake it awake.
Zoetic Theory
2nd-Level Animator Feature
You can give your homunculus materials to absorb into its body during a short or long rest. The material must have a value of at least 5 gp and for each additional component you use, the homunculus gains the corresponding feature. Adder’s Stomach. The homunculus can spit acid as a ranged weapon attack with a range of 30 feet that deals 1d6 + PB acid damage on a hit.
Eagle’s Eye. The homunculus gains proficiency with Perception checks and has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
Fur of Bat. The homunculus gains 30 feet of blindsight. The homunculus can’t use this blindsight while deafened.
Leech. The damage the homunculus deals with its Bite attack increases to 1d4 + PB and, when it hits a creature that is not a Construct or Undead, it can spend and roll one of its Hit Dice to regain hit points equal to the number rolled.
Spiderwebs. The homunculus gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed and can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
Anima Profane
6th-Level Animator Feature
Animators are shared within a secret ritual, one they helped to found with ancient necromancers. You gain the ability to cast the animate dead spell, but only as a ritual. The performance of this ritual is treated as if you are crafting an alchemical item for the purposes of your class features.
You must provide a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust as raw materials, which are consumed when you finish the ritual. The skeleton or zombie created through this ritual has the following changes:
• It is a construct rather than an undead.
• The creature’s hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your alchemist level.
• It gains the Telepathic Bond feature of your homunculus. Any creature you create with this ritual remains under your control until you perform the ritual again. When you do, the previously created creature dies immediately.
Life Stitcher
10th-Level Animator Feature
Your homunculus grows even stronger through the materials you provide, enhancing their effects:
Adder’s Stomach. The damage the homunculus deals when it hits a creature with its spit acid increases to 2d6 + PB.
Eagle’s Eye. The homunculus’ proficiency bonus is doubled for any Perception check it makes while it isn’t blinded.
Fur of Bat. The homunculus does not provoke opportunity attacks while using its fly speed.
Leech. The damage the homunculus deals with its Bite attack increases to 2d4 + PB.
Spiderwebs. Any climbing speed granted by this component increases by 10 feet.
Contemptible Chimera
14th-Level Animator Feature

 The flesh golem has the following changes:
• It gains the homunculus’ fly speed, Bite, Telepathic Bond, and any features you granted the homunculus through your Zoetic Theory.
• Its hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your alchemist level. The flesh golem dies immediately if you die or create a new construct from your alchemist features.

Spagyric Theory
2nd-Level Apothecary Feature
When you create an alchemical item or potion that restores hit points, you can infuse the item with specific materials to enhance it. The material must have a value of at least 5 gp and for each additional material you use, the item gains the corresponding effect:
Honeycomb. The item causes subtle changes in the consumer’s scent. Animals are put at ease by the scent, granting the consumer a bonus on Wisdom (Animal Handling) and Charisma checks made against beasts equal to your Intelligence modifier for 1 hour.
Powdered Gems. If the consumer is afflicted by a poison or disease that a successful saving throw would end, it can immediately attempt the saving throw when the item restores its hit points (no action required).

Powdered Silver. The next time the consumer makes a sav- ing throw within the next minute, they can roll a 2d4 and add the result rolled to the saving throw.
Troll’s Blood. The consumer of the item regains 2 hit points at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute. If the creature takes acid or fire damage, this effect doesn’t function at the start of the creature’s next turn. The creature’s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), are restored after 2 minutes, if the severed part is held to the stump.
Miracle Elixir
14th-Level Apothecary Feature
When you create a healing draught or potion of healing of any type, you can infuse it with 300 gp worth of diamond dust. If you administer the draught to a creature that has died within the last hour, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point. Doing so can’t return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.
Crystallographer
Often regarded as one of the most pure forms of alchemy, crystallography is the study of crystalline structures. They apply this knowledge in alchemy to swiftly create remarkably hard matter nearly instantaneously from chemical compounds.

Vitreus Theory
2nd-Level Crystallographer Feature
When you create an alchemical item that reduces a creature’s speed or that materializes into an object or structure (such as an instant wall), you can infuse the item with specific materials to enhance it. The material must have a value of at least 5 gp and for each additional material you use, the item gains the corresponding effect:
Banded Agate. The form of any structure created by using the item expands by 5 feet in one direction of your choice, provided the space it would enter is unoccupied.
Carbon. Any object or structure created by using the item is hardened, giving it an AC equal to your alchemy save DC and additional hit points equal to your alchemist level.
Cicada. For 1 minute, the target must make a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a failure, the creature must spend 2 feet of speed for every 1 foot it attempts to walk or climb. On a success, this effect ends.
Obsidian. The concoction swirls with sharp shards of obsidian glass. Each time the creature makes an ability check or saving throw against the alchemical item or comes into physical contact for the first time on its turn with an object or structure created by the item, it takes 1d6 piercing damage, as the shards pierce its body.
Sterner Stuff
6th-Level Crystallographer Feature
You can use your Eureka feature to create a nonmagical crystal or gem of your choice. You can create this item using valuables (such as gold pieces) of a value equal to half the value of the item.

Further, you can use Eureka to create a spark of creation, detailed after this subclass description. When you create it using this feature, you only need to provide a flask to contain the compound and a crystal worth 500 gp.
Fulminare
Sometimes dismissed by other alchemists as “mad bombers”, fulminares are specialists of combustion. The process of creation must have its opposite, and fulminares may be seen as those philosophers of destruction.

Nut Shells. The item sends a seismic shock, breaking apart the nearby earth, causing the ground within 10 feet of the area the item was thrown to become difficult terrain.
Quartz. When a creature takes damage from the item, it becomes dazed until the end of the turn. While dazed, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw before it makes an attack, or the attack misses. On a success, the target is no longer dazed.
Saltpeter. Increasing the item’s volatility, if the item only targets a single creature, you can instead target a point within the same range. All creatures within 10 feet of the point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your alchemy save DC or be subjected to the item’s effects as if they had been hit by an attack.
Powdered Arcane Focus. When you make an attack with the item, roll a d6 and consult the following table. Damage dealt by the item changes to the corresponding Damage Type.
d6 Damage Type d6 Damage Type
1 Cold 4 Psychic
2 Lightning 5 Radiant
3 Necrotic 6 Force
Hit the Deck
6th-Level Fulminare Feature
Having to react quickly to sudden, unstable explosives has heightened your instincts to danger. When you are forced to make a Dexterity saving throw against an effect you can see, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed immediately before the effect occurs, potentially moving out of the area of danger. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.
Chemical Warfare
10th-Level Fulminare Feature
The items you infuse with additional components grow even stronger, enhancing their effects:
Nut Shells. The area of the effect increases to 15 feet and deals double damage to objects that are not worn or carried and structures.
Quartz. When a creature takes damage from the item, it becomes dazed until the end of your next turn, rather than the end of the current turn.
Saltpeter. The area of the effect increases to 15 feet. Powdered Arcane Focus. When you roll on the table to determine the item’s damage type, roll 3d6 and choose one of the dice to use for the result instead.

Salbenist
The title of salbenist (literally “oil-user”) is bestowed upon one that wields blades coated in alchemical oil. A salbenist may be a devoutly anointed crusader, a warrior hailing from a tribe society founded near some free-flowing substance, or a vengeful witchhunter using concoctions to exploit the secret weaknesses of monsters.

Anointed Blade
2nd-Level Salbenist Feature
You can perform an anointing ritual over the course of 1 hour with a weapon you are proficient with and that lacks the twohanded property. During the ritual, you must coat the weapon with an oil, which is absorbed into the weapon and anoints it. Upon concluding the ritual, you gain the following benefits until you perform the anointing ritual on another weapon:
• When you attack with the anointed weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.
• When you equip the anointed weapon, you can will the oil absorbed into it to coat it. Doing so does not consume the oil, and the weapon remains coated until you dismiss it, it leaves your hand, or until you coat it with another oil.
• Whenever you make a damage roll for additional damage dealt with an oil and roll the highest value on one of the damage dice, you can roll that die one additional time and add the number rolled to the damage.
Extra Attack
6th-Level Salbenist Feature
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
All-Consuming Flame
10th-Level Salbenist Feature
When you take damage of the same type dealt by the oil anointing your weapon, you can use a reaction to reduce the damage you take to 0. When you do, you regain a number of hit points equal to the total damage reduced. If these hit points would exceed your hit point maximum, you can choose to instead gain the remainder as temporary hit points.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.
Soul of Cinder
14th-Level Salbenist Feature
Whenever you make a damage roll for additional damage dealt with an oil and roll the highest value on any of the dice, the attack’s damage ignores resistance and immunity.
Toxicologist
A reviled trade in most societies, toxicologists are alchemists that specialize in disease and poison. Other practices tend to view the toxicologist as a perversion of a sacred art, leading them to more often find a home within a thieves’ guild, supplying black markets with these insidious concoctions. They are a logistical keystone in the planning of assassinations requiring a more delicate touch, but some toxicologists are less secretive about their trade. There are adventurers that may break away from the traditional view of their title; a paladin may break their oath, or a cleric may worship a god of death. For alchemists, it’s the incorporation of poison in their sacred study they view as a foul practice that lingers in the shadow.

Desecrated Water. Any poison damage dealt by the item becomes necrotic damage.
Eye of Newt. While the target is poisoned in this way, the target takes 1d6 poison damage the first time it is hit with an attack on a turn.
Powdered Lead & a Flask. The poison becomes a toxic powder or gas that takes effect when inhaled, rather than its indicated method of subjecting a creature to its effects. As an action, you open or throw the flask to a point up to 20 feet away, shattering the flask. Creatures within 5 feet of the point are subjected to the poison.
Valerian Root. While the target is poisoned in this way, the target’s mind wracks with pain. Whenever the creature makes a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, it must subtract a d4 from the number rolled for the check.
Mithridatism
6th-Level Toxicologist Feature
You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the poisoned condition on yourself. You also have resistance to poison damage. Additionally, if another feature, item, or spell gives you resistance to poison damage, you can choose instead to gain one of the following benefits, which lasts for the duration listed in the effect (you choose when the effect takes place):
• You are immune to poison damage.
• You have resistance to acid damage.
• You have resistance to necrotic damage.
Malediction
10th-Level Apothecary Feature
The items you infuse with additional components grow even stronger, enhancing their effects:
Desecrated Water. Damage dealt by the item ignores resistance to necrotic damage.
Eye of Newt. The target takes an additional 1d6 poison damage from this effect.
Powdered Lead & a Flask. The area affected by the poison increases to 10 feet.
Valerian Root. Whenever the creature makes a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, it must subtract 2d4 from the number rolled for the check.
Demon Core
14th-Level Toxicologist Feature
The alchemical poisons you create have the potential to overcome natural defenses against them. Poisons you create have the following changes:
• They ignore resistance to poison damage.
• A creature that has immunity to poison damage instead takes half damage from the item instead of none.
• They ignore immunity to the poisoned condition, with these creatures instead making the saving throw with advantage.
Downtime
This chapter is a reorganization of the information already provided across the official books for clear, concise reference and ruling. The Alchemist and the items within were created to embrace the 5e crafting system rather than rewrite it, but these rules are somewhat scattered across the Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Masters Guide, and Xanathar’s Guide to Everything. Some of the rules that do not pertain to the alchemist’s class features have been omitted.
The footnotes within also address some questions that came up during playtest that felt necessary to highlight what rules class features may apply to.
Activities
Downtime activities require a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.
Crafting
Xanathar’s Guide to Everything pp. 128-130
You can craft nonmagical objects using a tool you are proficient with. You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with alchemist’s supplies needs a laboratory in order to craft a tanglefoot bag or acid.
For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value.7 8
 If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5-gp 7 This is what Experimentalist Adept was designed to enhance; making it more efficient for the alchemist to create the items they need for adventures. 8 "Raw Materials" is the term used in the official books to refer to any materials required to create the item. You do not need to provide gold pieces to create an item, you just need to purchase materials if you are not able to source them. increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.
Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.
While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5 for more information on lifestyle expenses).
Crafting an Item
A character who has the time, the money, and the needed tools can use downtime to craft armor, weapons, clothing, or other kinds of nonmagical gear.
Resources and Resolution. In addition to the appropriate tools for the item to be crafted, a character needs raw materials worth half of the item’s selling cost. To determine how many workweeks it takes to create an item, divide its gold piece cost by 50. A character can complete multiple items in a workweek if the items’ combined cost is 50 gp or lower. Items that cost more than 50 gp can be completed over longer periods of time, as long as the work in progress is stored in a safe location. Multiple characters can combine their efforts. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Use your judgment when determining how many characters can collaborate on an item. If all the above requirements are met, the result of the process is an item of the desired sort. A character can sell an item crafted in this way at its listed price.9
Crafting a Magic Item
Dungeon Master’s Guide pp. 128-129
Magic items are the DM’s purview, so you decide how they fall into the party’s possession. As an option, you can allow player characters to craft magic items.
The creation of a magic item is a lengthy, expensive task. To start, a character must have a formula that describes the construction of the item. The character must also be a spellcaster with spell slots and must be able to cast any spells that the item can produce. Moreover, the character must meet a level minimum determined by the item’s rarity, as shown in the
Crafting Magic Items table. For example, a 3rd-level character could create a wand of magic missiles (an uncommon item), as long as the character has spell slots and can cast magic missile. That same character could make a +1 weapon (another uncommon item), no particular spell required. 9 Note, this last sentence uses "can" in an odd way that may imply the character always gets market value if they sell an item. This would be a removal of DM agency that is very atypical of 5e rules wording, so I assume this was unintended You can decide that certain items also require special materials or locations to be created. For example, a character might need alchemist’s supplies to brew a particular potion, or the formula for a flame tongue might require that the weapon be forged with lava.
Crafting Magic Items
Item Rarity Creation Cost Minimum Level
Common 100 gp 3rd
Uncommon 500 gp 3rd
Rare 5,000 gp 6th
Very Rare 50,000 gp 11th
Legendary 500,000 gp 17th
An item has a creation cost specified in the Crafting Magic Items table (half that cost for a consumable, such as a potion or scroll). A character engaged in the crafting of a magic item makes progress in 25 gp increments, spending that amount for each day of work until the total cost is paid. The character is assumed to work for 8 hours each of those days. Thus, creating an uncommon magic item takes 20 days and 500 gp. You are free to adjust the costs to better suit your campaign.
If a spell will be produced by the item being created, the creator must expend one spell slot of the spell’s level for each day of the creation process. The spell’s material components must also be at hand throughout the process. If the spell normally consumes those components, they are consumed by the creation process. If the item will be able to produce the spell only once, as with a spell scroll, the components are consumed only once by the process. Otherwise, the components are consumed once each day of the item’s creation.
Multiple characters can combine their efforts to create a magic item if each of them meets the level prerequisite. Each character can contribute spells, spell slots, and components, as long as everyone participates during the entire crafting process. Each character can contribute 25 gp worth of effort for each day spent helping to craft the item.
Normally, a character who undertakes this activity creates a magic item described in chapter 7, “Treasure.” At your discretion, you can allow players to design their own magic items, using the guidelines in chapter 9, “Dungeon Master’s Workshop.” While crafting a magic item, a character can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay the 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5, “Equipment,” in the Player’s Handbook).
Magic Item Formulas
Dungeon Master’s Guide p. 141
A magic item formula explains how to make a particular magic item. Such a formula can be an excellent reward if you allow player characters to craft magic items.
You can award a formula in place of a magic item. Usually written in a book or on a scroll, a formula is one step rarer than the item it allows a character to create. For example, the formula for a common magic item is uncommon. No formulas exist for legendary items. If the creation of magic items is commonplace in your campaign, a formula can have a rarity that matches the rarity of the item it allows a character to create. Formulas for common and uncommon items might even be for sale, each with a cost double that of its magic item.
Brewing Potions of Healing
Potions of healing fall into a special category for item crafting, separate from other magic items. A character who has proficiency with the herbalism kit can create these potions. The times and costs for doing so are summarized on the Potion of Healing Creation table.
Potions of Healing Creation
Type Item Cost –Crafting Cost–
Time Cost
Healing 50 gp 1 day 25 gp
Greater 200 gp 1 wk 100 gp
Superior 2,000 gp 3 wks 1,000 gp
Supreme 20,000 gp 4 wks 10,000 gp
Foraging
An alchemist in need can resource the raw materials for their alchemical items from the surrounding environment. Should this come up in your games, the following variant rule has been provided.
Variant Rule: Foraging Raw Materials
Just as characters can gather food and water while traveling at a normal or slow pace, a foraging character can spend time gathering raw materials for crafting. When doing so, the character can make either an Intelligence (Nature) or a Wisdom (Survival) check after spending 1 hour foraging, with the DC determined by the abundance of resources in the region.
Raw Material Foraging
Resource Availability DC
Abundant 10
Limited 15
Scarce 20
If multiple characters forage, each character makes a separate check. A foraging character finds nothing on a failed check. On a successful check, roll 1d6 + the ability modifier used to determine the value of the raw materials (in gp) the character finds.
Equipment
A ppearing within this chapter are new items you can find during your adventures, as well as revised mechanics for certain alchemical items that previously appeared in the Player’s Handbook. The chapter begins with a section on new and reprinted Adventuring Gear, with Alchemical Items appearing afterwords.
When you choose the formulae for alchemical items you know as an Alchemist, the applicable items appear in the Adventuring Gear (Alchemical Items) table.
Revised Items
The design process of this class exposed a few hiccups with the original alchemical items in the Player’s Handbook, which could cause some confusion and potential unintended interactions. In short, these are quality of life mechanical changes to help clarify the use of these items with no change made to damage. A full breakdown of the reasons for these revisions is detailed in Appendix C.
Adventuring Gear
Unless otherwise stated in its description, if an item calls for an action, it is used with the Use an Object action.
Alembic. An airtight, glass distillation device.
Astrolabe. An astrolabe can be used as a part of making an ability check to navigate at night while stars or other planetary bodies are visible. If you do, the check is made with advantage.
Bellows. A device used to furnish a strong, short blast of air through a nozzle.
Brazier. A portable container used to burn charcoal or fuel.
Candle Mold. A mold is required, in addition to any wax, to make any candle with a weight of 1 pound or less.
Coffee Grounds. Boiling water can be poured through coffee grounds and filtered to make a cup of coffee.
Crucible. A small ceramic or metal container that can hold molten substances without breaking.
Earplugs. Made from solid sponge or cork, a creature wearing these earplugs is effectively deafened.
Glass Cutter. This special device allows you to cut through glass as thick as a half-inch, creating a circular hole between 3 to 16 inches wide (your choice).
Hammock. A portable sling bed made of interwoven rope or other textiles. It can be hung between two posts or trees to create a comfortable, elevated sleeping area.

Mortar and Pestle. A bowl and crusher used to grind material down to powder.
Periscope. A small, handheld periscope roughly 1 foot long. If you use a periscope while behind cover, you can look over obstacles and around corners without exposing yourself to danger.
Shriek Rock. These flat stones have carefully drilled holes that cause a loud, high-pitched “shriek” when thrown hard. This sound is as loud as a human screaming in a shrill voice.
Telescope. An instrument used to view planetary bodies.
Test Kit. This kit contains various materials for the testing of unknown magical and mundane fluids. A single kit typically contains leather gloves, clippers, five glass vials, strips of alchemical testing paper, a flask of alcohol. The kit has ten uses, one of which you can spend to gain advantage on an applicable Intelligence (Investigation) check.
Tongs. These are 1-foot-long metal tongs used to pick up objects that weigh as much as 1 pound without touching them directly.
New Equipment Packs
New packs are available to choose from when you choose your starting equipment. The contents of these packs are listed here. If you are buying your starting equipment, you can purchase a pack for the price shown, which might be cheaper than buying the items individually.
Astronomer’s Pack (40 gp). Includes a backpack, an astrolabe, a bottle of ink, an ink pen, a telescope, a scroll case full of diagrams on celestial bodies, and 10 sheets of parchment.
Demolitionist’s Pack (35 gp). Includes a backpack, bedroll, 3 flasks, 4 clay pots, earplugs, a hooded lantern, and a vial of gunpowder. The pack also has 30 feet of fuse packed within the chest.

Mediciner’s Pack (22 gp). Includes a backpack, a hammock, 3 flasks, 5 glass bottles, 10 days of rations, a waterskin, a healer’s kit, and an herbalism kit.
Tools
The following tools have been reproduced and reorganized here with their relevant information for ease of play with this class.
Artisan’s Tools
Player’s Handbook p. 154
These special tools include the items needed to pursue a craft or trade. Proficiency with a set of artisan’s tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make using the tools in your craft.
Alchemist’s Supplies
Alchemist’s supplies include two glass beakers, a metal frame to hold a beaker in place over an open flame, a glass stirring rod, a small mortar and pestle, and a pouch of common alchemical ingredients, including salt, powdered iron, and purified water.
Crafting. You can use this tool proficiency to create alchemical items. A character can spend money to collect raw materials, which weigh 1 pound for every 50 gp spent. The DM can allow a character to make a check using the indicated skill with advantage. As part of a long rest, you can use alchemist’s supplies to make one alchemical item with a value as high as 50 gp. Subtract half the value of the created item from the total gp worth of raw materials you are carrying.
Herbalism Kit
Proficiency with an herbalism kit allows you to identify plants and safely collect their useful elements. An herbalism kit includes pouches to store herbs, clippers and leather gloves for collecting plants, a mortar and pestle, and several glass jars.
Containers
Liquids must be used in specific volumes for their effects to occur. The container listed in the item and indicated in this column indicates the minimum amount of the substance required for its full effects to occur.

Alchemical Items
These items can be purchased with your starting equipment and crafted with alchemist’s supplies. They are shown in the Adventuring Gear (Alchemical Items) table with a Container, Cost, and Weight (Wt.), and described in the Alchemical Items section in this chapter.
Some alchemical items have a secondary classification, shown in italics. This is meant for ease of reference, but certain classifications obey certain rules:
Acid. Acids are naturally occurring or originate from a certain creature (such as a black dragon). However, some acids are mundane chemical mixtures that may be created in a laboratory with alchemist’s supplies and are listed here.
Oils. Oils are nearly always a substance that must be coated onto a creature or object. The action required to do so is listed in its description.

Item Type: Alchemical Item
This supplement aims to solidify a term that has mostly been used in abstraction; “alchemical items.” This is not a blanket term to refer to “any item an alchemist can make,” but rather a classification of “nonmagical items created through a process of chemical reactions.” For example, the alchemist’s fire is considered to be a chemical substance that ignites when exposed to the air through natural reactions, but a potion of healing is a liquid that magically mends wounds by consuming it.
When playing this class, it should be understood that if a feature refers to an alchemical item, it is not being used to encompass poisons or potions unless specifically stated. Features like Alchemy and Lightning in a Bottle are designed and balanced around this assumption. This class allows you to create alchemical items in the middle of combat, while still providing you with the features to create permanent potions more easily within the official rules provided for downtime crafting.
Alchemical Item Descriptions
The alchemical items are listed in alphabetical order.
• Acid, Basic
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Vial (1 ounce)
You can splash the contents of the vial or throw it, shattering the vial, up to 20 feet as a ranged simple weapon attack with either the Attack or Use an Object action. When you do, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as a ranged simple weapon. On a hit, the attack deals 2d6 acid damage. If the vial is thrown, it shatters on impact.
Acid, Oxidizing Agent
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Vial (1 ounce)
You can splash the contents of the vial or throw it, shattering the vial, up to 20 feet as a ranged simple weapon attack with either the Attack or Use an Object action. When you do, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as a ranged simple weapon. On a hit, the acid corrodes nonmagical ferrous metal, dealing 2d10 acid damage if the target is a construct made of metal. If the target is an object that isn’t being worn or carried, the acid destroys a 1-footradius circle that is 1-inch deep. If the target is a creature wearing or carrying the object, choose one of the objects to target from either its armor, shield, or weapon:
• The armor or shield takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed.
• The weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed.
• Adhesive
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Vial (1 ounce)
A sticky substance used to adhere materials together. • Alchemist’s Fire Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Flask (1 pint)
This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. You can throw this flask up to 20 feet with either the Attack or Use an Object action, shattering it on impact. When you do, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist’s fire as a ranged simple weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.
• Alkahest
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Vial (1 ounce)
When poured on or within an alchemical item, the item is reduced back to its raw materials after 1 minute. The alkahest is lost in the process.
• Antitoxin
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Vial (1 ounce)
A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.
• Candle, Basic
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
• Candle, Focusing
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. While burning, the focusing candle fills the air within 20 feet with a fresh, crisp odor. The candle is a great boon to those engaged in strenuous mental activity, granting a +1 bonus to any ability check made with artisan’s tools during the hour.
• Candle, Insectbane
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. This heavily scented candle smells pleasant to humanoids, but is especially potent in repelling insects, which are frightened while within 20 feet of a burning insectbane candle.
• Candle, Restful
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. While this thick blue candle burns, it fills the air with a relaxing scent. If a creature within 20 feet of the lit candle spends one or more Hit Dice as a part of a short rest to regain hit points, the hit points they regain are doubled.
• Clearbreath
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Vial (1 ounce)
Gray, smokey vapors that temporarily dull one’s sense of smell when inhaled. You can use the vial to inhale the clearbreath within to gain a bonus to Constitution saving throws made against foul smells (such as a catoblepas’ stench) for 1 hour. This bonus is either +2 or the creator of the clearbreath’s Intelligence modifier (whichever is higher).
• Darkvision Powder
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Vial (1 ounce)
This plain gray powder can’t be seen with normal vision from more than 10 feet away, and is often used by creatures with darkvision to write messages hidden in plain sight. When viewed with darkvision, the powder glows brightly. A vial contains enough powder to write a fairly lengthy sentence (roughly 25 words).
• Defoliator
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Flask (1 pint)
This vile liquid has a muddy brown hue and smells of rotten plant life. You can throw a flask of defoliator at a target within 20 feet with either the Attack or Use Object action, shattering the flask on impact. All plant creatures within 10 feet of the point must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 2d4 poison damage. Medium or smaller naturally growing plants in the area immediately wither and die. The damage is not limited to living plants: wooden objects and structures take double damage from a defoliator.
• Dwarfblind Stone
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Small stones treated with alchemical substances, giving them a faint purple sheen. As an action, you can throw a dwarfblind stone at a point up to 60 feet away. Once the stone strikes a hard surface, it releases a burst of violet light that illuminates a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the point that vanishes in an instant and temporarily interferes with the darkvision. Creatures with darkvision within the area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or lose their darkvision for 10 minutes.
• Fleetfoot
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Flask (1 pint)
This thin blue liquid temporarily loosens the consumer’s muscles and joints. For 1 minute, the consumer’s walking speed and jump distance are increased by 10 feet. This additional distance does not apply to any fly or swim speeds the consumer may have.
• Frigid Azote
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Flask (1 pint)
A liquid that rapidly freezes tissue when it comes into direct contact. You can splash the contents of the flask or throw it up to 20 feet as a ranged simple weapon attack with either the Attack or Use an Object action. When you do, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the frigid azote as a ranged simple weapon. On a hit, the attack deals 2d6 cold damage and the target’s speed is halved until the end of its next turn. If the vial is thrown, it shatters on impact.
• Gravebane
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Flask (1 pint)
This thick white liquid evaporates almost instantly upon contact with air, creating a thin, nearly invisible smoke. The smoke is nearly odorless and has no effect on most creatures. Undead, however, are repulsed by the smoke and can only pass through it with an effort of will. As an action, you open or throw the flask to a point up to 20 feet away, shattering the flask. In either case, the area in a 10-foot radius becomes filled with gravebane. Gravebane ordinarily lasts for 1 minute, although strong winds may decrease this duration. Undead that try to enter the area must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from the area of smoke as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of the smoke. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action to try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
• Green Slime
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Pot (1 gallon)
You can throw this pot of green slime at a target within 20 feet with either the Attack or Use Object action, breaking it open on impact. When you do, make a ranged attack against the creature or object, treating the green slime as a ranged simple weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 acid damage and is covered in slime until a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the slime off. A target covered in the slime takes 1d10 acid damage at the start of each of its turns.
• Healing Draught
Adventuring gear (alchemical Item)
Container: Vial (1 ounce)
A creature that consumes the contents of the vial can spend and roll its Hit Dice and regain a number of hit points equal to the roll. The maximum number of Hit Dice it can spend by consuming the contents is equal to the creature’s Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).
• Holy Water
Adventuring Gear (alchemical item)
Container: Flask (1 pint)
As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet with either the Attack or Use an Object action, shattering it on impact. When you do, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the holy water as a ranged simple weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.
A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.
• Insect Repellent-Salve
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Vial (1 ounce)
A vial of this waterproof salve contains 20 applications of odorless grease. Applying the salve takes 1 minute, and one application protects its wearer against normal insects for 24 hours.
• Instant Rope
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Flask (1 pint)
As an action, you can pour the viscous gray liquid from this flask. When poured, the liquid forms into a long cord usable as a temporary rope. Upon being exposed to air, the liquid rapidly increases in both volume and viscosity, swelling to the diameter of a typical hemp rope, then quickly drying.
A flask of instant rope forms a 50-foot-long cord and solidifies at the end of your next turn. The rope can be moved during this period without damaging it, but it cannot support more than 10 pounds of weight without breaking. Once completely dry, instant rope can support as much weight as normal hemp rope. After an hour, instant rope becomes too brittle to support any weight and quickly crumbles into dust.
• Instant Wall
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Flask (1 pint)
A foamy compound that quickly expands and hardens when exposed to air. You can throw this flask at a point within 20 feet with either the Attack or Use an Object action, shattering it on impact. When you do, the contents of the vial expand to a 10-foot-square panel of tough stone-like matter that is 1 foot thick, with the face of the wall facing you. The wall lasts until the end of your next turn, then it crumbles to dust.
If the block cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to the opposite side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save. The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 10 hit points, and is vulnerable to bludgeoning and thunder damage.
• Levin Shell
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Flask (1 pint)
An unstable mass of electric energy that sparks when exposed to air. You can throw this flask up to 20 feet with either the Attack or Use an Object action, shattering it on impact. When you do, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the levin shell as a ranged simple weapon. On a hit, the target and any creatures within 5 feet of the target take 1d6 lightning damage. Any creature that takes this damage suffers a 1d4 penalty to Dexterity saving throws until the end of its next turn.
• Longbreath
Adventuring Gear (alchemical item)
Container: Vial (1 ounce)
This thick, brown-tinted smoke is a great boon to anyone who needs to go without air for more than a few rounds. For 1 hour after inhaling the contents of the vial, the creature can hold its breath indefinitely while it’s not incapacitated.
•Motelight
Adventuring Gear (alchemical item)
Container: Flask (1 pint)
This flask contains a clear liquid filled with faintly glowing sparks of light. You can throw this flask at a point up to 20 feet with either the Attack or Use an Object action, shattering it on impact. When it shatters, any creatures within 5 feet of the point become surrounded by rapidly moving, harmless sparks that follow the creature until the start of your next turn. These sparks carry wild energy that disrupts magic, and if the creature attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed on a concentration check or the spell fails and the spell slot is expended.
• Oil, Basic
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Flask (1 pint)
As an action, you can splash the oil onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet with either the Attack or Use an Object action, shattering it on impact. When you do, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the oil as a ranged simple weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil, which is burned away. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.
• Oil, Anointing
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Flask (1 pint)
Anointing oil is used in religious ceremonies, often as a mix of oil and holy water. The oil can coat one metal weapon or up to 5 pieces of metal ammunition. Applying the oil takes an action, coating the item for 1 hour. When you hit a fiend or undead with the coated item, the attack deals an extra 1d6 radiant damage. If you apply another oil to the coated weapon, it loses these effects.
• Oil, Bladefire
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Flask (1 pint)
Bladefire is typically poured along the length of a bladed metal weapon. The oil can coat one metal weapon or up to 5 pieces of metal ammunition. Applying the oil takes an action. For 1 hour, the coated item sheds light as if it were a torch and deals an extra 1d4 fire damage on a hit. While coated, the item can ignite a flammable object it touches as an action. If you apply another oil to the coated weapon, it loses these effects.
• Oil, Crone’s Ire
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
A sickly emerald oil that shrieks when lit. The oil can coat one metal weapon or up to 5 pieces of metal ammunition. Applying the oil takes an action. For 1 hour, the coated item sheds dim light out to 5 feet and deals an extra 1d4 necrotic damage on a hit. If this damage forces a creature to make a concentration check, the necrotic damage dealt is subtracted from its roll. If you apply another oil to the coated weapon, it loses these effects.
• Oil, Dragonwound
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Flask (1 pint)
Dragonwound oil is typically poured along the length of a bladed metal weapon. The oil can coat one metal weapon or up to 5 pieces of metal ammunition. Applying the oil takes an action, coating the item for 1 hour. When you hit a dragon with the coated item, the dragon takes an extra 1d6 force damage and its fly speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. If you apply another oil to the coated weapon, it loses these effects.
• Oil, Farflame
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Flask (1 pint)
This thin, light blue oil burns with a blue flame and illuminates a wide area. When used in a lantern, farflame oil sheds bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. In a bullseye lantern, it illuminates a cone 80 feet long and 25 feet wide. A pint of farflame oil fuels a lantern for 3 hours and can cover a 5-foot square area if poured on the ground. If lit, farflame oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 1d4 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area.
• Oil, Ghostflame
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
This clear oil has a slight tint of gray, and strange, wispy forms seem to swirl through it. The oil can coat one metal weapon or up to 5 pieces of metal ammunition. Applying the oil takes an action. For 1 hour, attacks made with the weapon count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. If you apply another oil to the coated weapon, it loses these effects.
• Oil, Vicious Bleeder
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
A thick blue oil that acts as a powerful anticoagulant. The oil can coat one metal weapon or up to 5 pieces of metal ammunition. Applying the oil takes an action, coating the item for 1 hour. When you make an attack against a creature that is not a construct, elemental, ooze, or undead with the coated item, the attack deals an additional 1d6 damage and the creature bleeds heavily from the wound for 1 hour, granting advantage on any ability check made to track it. If you apply another oil to the coated weapon, it loses these effects.
• Perfume (vial)
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
A fragrant commodity typically used by the wealthy.
• Polar Skin
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Vial (1 ounce)
This dull white cream provides limited protection against the cold when applied to a creature. A vial of this dull-white cream contains 20 applications. Applying the cream takes 1 minute, and one application protects its wearer against the effects of extreme cold for 24 hours.
• Shriek Paste
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Vial (1 ounce)
The shrieker, a common fungus found in the bowels of the Underdark, is sometimes cultivated by drow societies, creating a first line of defense against intrusion around their cities. In addition, drow alchemists harvest and render the fungus down to a base substance capable of reproducing the shrieker’s howl.
Shriek paste is an oily, smelly substance with a slightly purplish color that is typically stored in opaque containers to prevent illuminating the paste. When smeared on a surface, it retains its same consistency almost indefinitely. When bright light is within 30 feet of the paste, the paste rapidly crystallizes. During this process, the paste emits a shriek audible within 300 feet of it for 1 minute. If the light moves out of range, the shriek ends after 1d4 rounds. Afterward, the paste dries up and is rendered inert.
• Spark of Creation
Wondrous item (alchemical item), very rare
Container: Flask (1 pint)
A terrifying substance said to be incomprehensibly volatile and massless, though theorized to have been an essence that triggered the beginning of everything. You can throw this flask up to 20 feet with either the Attack or Use an Object action, shattering it on impact. When you do, make a ranged attack against a creature or object. On a hit, eight 5-foot diameter crystaline spires burst forth at points of your choice within 30 feet of the shattered flask. Each spire has a height of up to 30 feet, with AC 5 and 30 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a spire crumbles to rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 5-foot radius that lasts until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.
If the spire is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the spire. A creature can choose to fail this save.
If a spire is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the spire takes 6d6 piercing damage and is restrained, pinned between the spire and the obstacle. The restained creature can use an action to make a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity check (the creature’s choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restained and must either move off the pillar or fall off of it.
• Splash Catalyst
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Vial (1 ounce)
When combined with an alchemical item or potion, the catalyst increases the item’s volatility. If the item only targets a single creature, you can instead target a point within the same range. All creatures within 5 feet of the point must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw (which they can choose to fail) or be subjected to the item’s effects as if they had been hit by an attack made using the item.
• Soap
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
A commodity used for bathing.
• Sparkstone
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
These alchemical devices actually resemble fist-sized lumps of hard, gray clay. You can throw a sparkstone up to 20 feet at a target as a ranged simple weapon attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 lightning damage and can’t take reactions until the start of your next turn.
• Smelling Salts
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Vial (1 ounce)
As an action, this vial of pungent fluid can be administered by wafting the contents under a creature’s nose. If the creature is unconscious by an effect that put it to sleep, it immediately wakes up.
• Smokestick
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
As an action, you can ignite this alchemically treated wooden stick to instantly produce a thick plume of opaque smoke that blocks vision, including darkvision. You can hold onto the stick or throw it to a point up to 30 feet away as a part of the action used to ignite it. The area in a 10-foot radius around the stick is filled with thick smoke. The stick and smoke persist for 1 minute and then disappear.
• Sunrod
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
This 1-foot-long, gold-tipped, iron rod glows brightly when struck. You can strike the sunrod as an action, causing it to provide bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. It glows for 6 hours, after which the gold tip is burned out and worthless.
• Tanglefoot Bag
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Sack
This bag is filled with writhing, sticky black tar. As an action, you can burst the bag on a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, which causes the goo in the bag to burst out. In either case, make a ranged attack against the target, treating the bag as a ranged simple weapon. On a hit, the target becomes grappled by the goo (escape DC 10) that starts to harden when exposed to the air. A tanglefoot bag has no effect underwater. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained.
The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 1 hour, freeing any creatures restrained by it.
• Thunderstone
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
You can throw this stone at a point within 20 feet with either the Attack or Use Object action. When it strikes a hard surface, it creates a deafening bang, forcing each creature within 10 feet of the point to make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d8 thunder damage and be deafened until the end of its next turn. A creature deafened in this way also has disadvantage on initiative checks.
• Torch, Beast-Repellent
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20- foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage. A beast-repellent torch burns with an unnatural dark flame that unsettles beasts. A beast within 30 feet of a burning beast-repellent torch that can see it must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the torch until it is attacked or takes damage. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature cannot be frightened by beast-repellent torches for 24 hours.
• Torch, Frigidflame
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright white light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch of frigidflame and hit, it deals 1 cold damage.
• Torch, Sentry
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright all-revealing light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage. Invisible creatures and objects within the bright light provided by the sentry torch become visible.
• Torch, Tindertwig
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
The alchemical substance on the end of this small, wooden stick ignites when struck against a rough surface. You can ignite it as an action by hitting a solid surface. The flame does not damage the tindertwig and can ignite a flammable object it touches. You can snuff out the flame as an action.
• Verminbane
Adventuring gear (alchemical item)
Container: Flash (1 pint)
This tightly sealed flask contains a pale green smoke. When released into the air, the smoke fills a 5-foot-square area. Most creatures are unaffected by the smoke, although humanoids generally find the smell unpleasant. Rats and other rodents, however, find the smoke almost intolerable. As an action, you open or throw the flask to a point up to 20 feet away, shattering the flask. In either case, the area in a 10-foot radius becomes heavily obscured with verminbane smoke. Verminbane ordinarily lasts for 1 minute, although strong winds may decrease this duration.
Rodent-like creatures (DMs discretion) that attempt to enter the area must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is frightened of the smoke and must spend its turns trying to move as far away from the area of smoke as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of the smoke. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action to try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
Poisons
Poisons come in the following four types. The Craftable Poisons table listed below details the poisons that do not require harvesting from a certain creature to make that are listed in the official books.
Contact. Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.
Ingested. A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You might decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.
Inhaled. These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.
Injury. Can be applied to one slashing or piercing weapon, up to three pieces of ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent for 1 minute. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.

• Drow Poison
Poison (Injury)
This poison is typically made only by the drow, and only in a place far removed from sunlight. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.
• Essence of Ether

Appendices
Design Notes
Item Rewrites
Some alchemical items received revisions to help with their mechanics in play. There’s been a debate online about how these items are intended to be used, without clear ruling having been given by Wizards of the Coast.
Use an Object
You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.
For those unfamiliar with the problem; Acid, Alchemist’s Fire, and Holy Water were all written essentially as follows:
Alchemical Item. As an action, you can splash the contents of this container onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the item as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is subjected to the item’s effects.
This wording can be a bit unclear or potentially bring up issues for a few reasons. This isn’t to say these are intended for the mechanic, just the logic that leads to misinterpretations:
• The addition of “make a ranged attack” in the item’s description could be interpreted to mean your Dexterity modifier is added to, at the very least, the first damage roll of the item. Despite him saying not to take his Tweets at face value, Jeremy Crawford has stated this was how the item is intended to work, although it’s worth mentioning here that I disagree with the Dexterity modifier adding to the subsequent rolls of alchemist’s fire.
• The mechanics for Improvised Weapons imply that an improvised weapon attack can be made with any object using the Attack action. The addition of “improvised weapon” in the item’s description and the fact that an alchemical item within a vial doesn’t shatter by, effectively, performing the same actions in the narrative is counter-intuitive and seems to only be put in place to prevent martialists from using more than one of these items at a time.
• The item itself does not specifically state if the use includes the damage of an improvised weapon. That’s before even talking about the “Net Problem”, wherein an item or weapon that calls for a ranged attack against a creature within 5 feet of you is always made with disadvantage.
Improvised Weapons
Player’s Handbook pp. 147-148
Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin. Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM’s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.
An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals ld4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals ld4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.
Attack for Alchemical Item
This interaction would cause the item to deal 1d4 + Dexterity modifier damage when used as a ranged improvised weapon, but the judgment on whether or not this specific interaction would cause the item to work would point towards “no”, which is just bad narrative conveyance. Use Object for Alchemical Item
This appears to be the intended action to use for alchemical items, with the interaction itself simply lifting the clause for improvised weapons. The murkiness happens when you look at the text for improvised weapons, which states that in doing so it deals 1d4 damage of a type appropriate for the item, with nothing in either the item or Improvised Weapon wording clarifying whether or not this additional damage applies to the damage dealt in the item’s description.
The Fix
Moving alchemical items away from the Use an Object action and over towards the Attack action actually updates the Player’s Handbook to be consistent with the mechanics for alchemical items in later books. Remove Improvised from Alchemical Items. This “coding” for the items only exists in the Player’s Handbook. Attack or Use an Object. Allowing the item to be used with the Attack action or Use an Object enhances narrative cohession

FAQ
Question: Can I create alchemical items from the alchemist class as a downtime activity that are permanent?
Answer: Yes. This is a thing you could already do within the offi - cial rules. The alchemist can just do it more efficiently through their Experimentalist Adept feature.
Question: What do the crafting rules mean by gold required if crafting requires materials to craft the item?
Answer: The Cost indicated in the Player’s Handbook and simi - lar materials list the “market value” of the item. This has been used in the Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Masters Guide, and a few other official books. When you craft an item, the term “raw materials” is used to refer to essentially “anything re - quired to make the item (DM’s discretion)”. This supplement adopts this and is designed to embrace it rather than override the base crafting system.
Question: So I don’t have to spend gold to craft?
Answer: No. The gold called for is the market value of the item. In the case of single-use items (such as most alchemical items and consumable potions), you divide the market value in half to get you the cost of raw materials required to create the item. You may have to spend gold to gather raw materials, but this supple - ment provides a variant rule for gathering them whole foraging.
Question: Does the new wording for Alchemical Items cause them to interact with Archery & Sharpshooter?
Answer: Here’s the thing; they already did. It seems to me that there’s a belief that they shouldn’t, so if you’re not comfortable with this interaction, I would suggest a rule that those features only work with bows and crossbows.
Question: Why can’t we make this character in the base game?
Answer: I feel that the Artificer Alchemist isn’t a great repre - sentation of the traditional archetype of an alchemist. The tie-in with the Artificer seems to inject a certain flavor on the character option that had turned me away from it.
• Underserved/Restrictive Crafting Rules: The rules for craft - ing in 5e essentially gate martial crafters out of reasonable combat effectiveness.
• Object Permanence: When you create a potion, you would like for it to remain permanently until used. However, this causes issues with what I call “Batman Prep.” Batman prep means that, if allowed the time and resources, a character can do something that makes them effectively unstoppable in any situation. Potions of healing last indefinitely, which means that’s a narrative expectation we should be aiming to design for.
• Ignorance of Encumbrance: The most common houserule out of any houserule is that players are likely allowed to ignore what’s in their pack (within reason). We cannot bal - ance around encumbrance in 5e because items like the bag of holding exist and are basically expected for a party to have before 5th level.
• Value over Interaction: The general rules for collecting materials that would be used in creating potions is mostly limited in description to “gp value” rather than a hard-set material narrative.
