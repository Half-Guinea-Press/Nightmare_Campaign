# Alchemical Practices

Alchemists dedicate themselves to a Practice, a specialization that describes their passion for alchemy. The following practice options are available for you to choose from at 2nd level.

Animator

Stirring from the theories of a primordial soup that spawned all life as we know it, Animators are alchemists seeking to synthesize life. They are creators of alchemical constructs, known as homunculus, that are often found with the animator serving as an assistant in their research.

Homunculus Companion

2nd-Level Animator Feature

You can conduct a ritual over the course of an hour, shaping a mixture of 25 gp worth of clay, ash, mandrake root, and blood. After the ritual, you gain the service of a homunculus. Your homunculus is a faithful companion, and it dies if you die. You determine the homunculus’s appearance. See this creature’s game statistics in the Alchemical Homunculus stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.

In combat, the homunculus shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The homunculus is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your telepathic commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger. If you are incapacitated, the homunculus can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

You can’t have more than one homunculus at a time. If you attempt to create another while you have a homunculus, the creation fails.

Zoetic Theory

2nd-Level Animator Feature

You can give your homunculus materials to absorb into its body during a short or long rest. The material must have a value of at least 5 gp and for each additional component you use, the homunculus gains the corresponding feature. Adder’s Stomach. The homunculus can spit acid as a ranged weapon attack with a range of 30 feet that deals 1d6 + PB acid damage on a hit.

Eagle’s Eye. The homunculus gains proficiency with Perception checks and has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

Fur of Bat. The homunculus gains 30 feet of blindsight. The homunculus can’t use this blindsight while deafened.

Leech. The damage the homunculus deals with its Bite attack increases to 1d4 + PB and, when it hits a creature that is not a Construct or Undead, it can spend and roll one of its Hit Dice to regain hit points equal to the number rolled.

Spiderwebs. The homunculus gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed and can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

Anima Profane

6th-Level Animator Feature

Animators are shared within a secret ritual, one they helped to found with ancient necromancers. You gain the ability to cast the animate dead spell, but only as a ritual. The performance of this ritual is treated as if you are crafting an alchemical item for the purposes of your class features.

You must provide a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust as raw materials, which are consumed when you finish the ritual. The skeleton or zombie created through this ritual has the following changes:

• It is a construct rather than an undead.

• The creature’s hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your alchemist level.

• It gains the Telepathic Bond feature of your homunculus. Any creature you create with this ritual remains under your control until you perform the ritual again. When you do, the previously created creature dies immediately.

Life Stitcher

10th-Level Animator Feature

Your homunculus grows even stronger through the materials you provide, enhancing their effects:

Adder’s Stomach. The damage the homunculus deals when it hits a creature with its spit acid increases to 2d6 + PB.

Eagle’s Eye. The homunculus’ proficiency bonus is doubled for any Perception check it makes while it isn’t blinded.

Fur of Bat. The homunculus does not provoke opportunity attacks while using its fly speed.

Leech. The damage the homunculus deals with its Bite attack increases to 2d4 + PB.

Spiderwebs. Any climbing speed granted by this component increases by 10 feet.

Contemptible Chimera

14th-Level Animator Feature

If your homunculus and a construct created with your Anima Profane are within 5 feet of each other, you can use an action to command the two to merge, creating a companion flesh golem that you control in the same way as a homunculus you create.6

The flesh golem has the following changes:

• It gains the homunculus’ fly speed, Bite, Telepathic Bond, and any features you granted the homunculus through your Zoetic Theory.

• Its hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your alchemist level. The flesh golem dies immediately if you die or create a new construct from your alchemist features.

Apothecary

While laughter might be the best medicine, it never cured filth fever. Apothecaries are medical practitioners, creating potent potions to cure what ails.

Apothecary Features

Holistic Medicine

2nd-Level Apothecary Feature

You gain proficiency in the Medicine, Nature, or Survival skill (your choice) and you have advantage on any ability check you make to forage in nature for raw materials. Additionally, you learn the formula for healing draught or one alchemical item of your choice if you already know it.

Spagyric Theory

2nd-Level Apothecary Feature

When you create an alchemical item or potion that restores hit points, you can infuse the item with specific materials to enhance it. The material must have a value of at least 5 gp and for each additional material you use, the item gains the corresponding effect:

Honeycomb. The item causes subtle changes in the consumer’s scent. Animals are put at ease by the scent, granting the consumer a bonus on Wisdom (Animal Handling) and Charisma checks made against beasts equal to your Intelligence modifier for 1 hour.

Powdered Gems. If the consumer is afflicted by a poison or disease that a successful saving throw would end, it can immediately attempt the saving throw when the item restores its hit points (no action required).

Powdered Silver. The next time the consumer makes a sav6 Monster Manual, p. 169 ing throw within the next minute, they can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the saving throw.

Sweet Succor

6th-Level Apothecary Feature

You have advantage on Medicine checks you make to stabilize dying creatures and, when a creature consumes an alchemical item or potion you administer or create that restores hit points, the first healing roll of the item gains a bonus equal to your Intelligence modifier.

Panacea

10th-Level Apothecary Feature

The items you infuse with additional components grow even stronger, enhancing their effects:

Honeycomb. The item causes subtle changes in the consumer’s scent. Animals are put at ease by the scent, granting the consumer a bonus on Wisdom (Animal Handling) and Charisma checks made against beasts equal to your Intelligence modifier for 1 hour and advantage on these checks.

Powdered Gems. If the consumer is afflicted by any condition that a successful saving throw would end, it can immediately attempt the saving throw when the item restores its hit points (no action required).

Powdered Silver. The next time the consumer makes a sav- ing throw within the next minute, they can roll a 2d4 and add the result rolled to the saving throw.

Troll’s Blood. The consumer of the item regains 2 hit points at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute. If the creature takes acid or fire damage, this effect doesn’t function at the start of the creature’s next turn. The creature’s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), are restored after 2 minutes, if the severed part is held to the stump.

Miracle Elixir

14th-Level Apothecary Feature

When you create a healing draught or potion of healing of any type, you can infuse it with 300 gp worth of diamond dust. If you administer the draught to a creature that has died within the last hour, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point. Doing so can’t return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.

Crystallographer

Often regarded as one of the most pure forms of alchemy, crystallography is the study of crystalline structures. They apply this knowledge in alchemy to swiftly create remarkably hard matter nearly instantaneously from chemical compounds.

Crystal Alchemy

2nd-Level Crystallographer Feature

You gain proficiency with jeweler’s tools and you learn the formula for frigid azote or one alchemical item of your choice if you already know it.

Further, whenever a creature makes an ability check or saving throw to end an effect caused by one of your alchemical items that reduced its speed, the creature must roll 1d4 and subtract the number rolled from the d20 roll.

Vitreus Theory

2nd-Level Crystallographer Feature

When you create an alchemical item that reduces a creature’s speed or that materializes into an object or structure (such as an instant wall), you can infuse the item with specific materials to enhance it. The material must have a value of at least 5 gp and for each additional material you use, the item gains the corresponding effect:

Banded Agate. The form of any structure created by using the item expands by 5 feet in one direction of your choice, provided the space it would enter is unoccupied.

Carbon. Any object or structure created by using the item is hardened, giving it an AC equal to your alchemy save DC and additional hit points equal to your alchemist level.

Cicada. For 1 minute, the target must make a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a failure, the creature must spend 2 feet of speed for every 1 foot it attempts to walk or climb. On a success, this effect ends.

Obsidian. The concoction swirls with sharp shards of obsidian glass. Each time the creature makes an ability check or saving throw against the alchemical item or comes into physical contact for the first time on its turn with an object or structure created by the item, it takes 1d6 piercing damage, as the shards pierce its body.

Sterner Stuff

6th-Level Crystallographer Feature

You can use your Eureka feature to create a nonmagical crystal or gem of your choice. You can create this item using valuables (such as gold pieces) of a value equal to half the value of the item. The value of the item can’t be more than 50 times your alchemist level, and disappears after a number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus.

Matter Maker

10th-Level Crystallographer Feature

The items you infuse with additional components grow even stronger, enhancing their effects:

Cicada. The item also affects a creature’s fly or swim speed. Obsidian. The piercing damage increases to 2d6.

Prima Materia

Having tapped into the prime material of creation, your alchemy toys with the laws of conservation. Any item you create with Sterner Stuff no longer disappears as per that feature. Further, you can use Eureka to create a spark of creation, detailed after this subclass description. When you create it using this feature, you only need to provide a flask to contain the compound and a crystal worth 500 gp.

Fulminare

Sometimes dismissed by other alchemists as “mad bombers”, fulminares are specialists of combustion. The process of creation must have its opposite, and fulminares may be seen as those philosophers of destruction.

Instruments of Destruction

2nd-Level Fulminare Feature

Further, whenever you deal damage with an alchemical item roll the highest value on one of the damage dice, you can roll the die one additional time and add the number rolled to the damage.

Phlogiston Theory

2nd-Level Fulminare Feature

When you create a thrown alchemical item that deals damage, you can infuse the item with additional components to enhance it. The material must have a value of at least 5 gp and for each additional material you use, the item gains the corresponding effect:

Nut Shells. The item sends a seismic shock, breaking apart the nearby earth, causing the ground within 10 feet of the area the item was thrown to become difficult terrain.

Quartz. When a creature takes damage from the item, it becomes dazed until the end of the turn. While dazed, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw before it makes an attack, or the attack misses. On a success, the target is no longer dazed.

Saltpeter. Increasing the item’s volatility, if the item only targets a single creature, you can instead target a point within the same range. All creatures within 10 feet of the point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your alchemy save DC or be subjected to the item’s effects as if they had been hit by an attack.

Powdered Arcane Focus. When you make an attack with the item, roll a d6 and consult the following table. Damage dealt by the item changes to the corresponding Damage Type.

d6 Damage Type d6 Damage Type

1 Cold 4 Psychic

2 Lightning 5 Radiant

3 Necrotic 6 Force

Hit the Deck

6th-Level Fulminare Feature

Having to react quickly to sudden, unstable explosives has heightened your instincts to danger. When you are forced to make a Dexterity saving throw against an effect you can see, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed immediately before the effect occurs, potentially moving out of the area of danger. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

Chemical Warfare

10th-Level Fulminare Feature

The items you infuse with additional components grow even stronger, enhancing their effects:

Nut Shells. The area of the effect increases to 15 feet and deals double damage to objects that are not worn or carried and structures.

Quartz. When a creature takes damage from the item, it becomes dazed until the end of your next turn, rather than the end of the current turn.

Saltpeter. The area of the effect increases to 15 feet. Powdered Arcane Focus. When you roll on the table to determine the item’s damage type, roll 3d6 and choose one of the dice to use for the result instead.

Spontaneous Combustion

14th-Level Fulminare Feature

Whenever you deal damage with an alchemical item that deals bludgeoning, fire, or thunder damage and roll the highest value on any of the damage dice, you can roll those dice an additional time and add the number rolled to the damage. You can continue to do so with the additional dice as well.

Salbenist

The title of salbenist (literally “oil-user”) is bestowed upon one that wields blades coated in alchemical oil. A salbenist may be a devoutly anointed crusader, a warrior hailing from a tribe society founded near some free-flowing substance, or a vengeful witchhunter using concoctions to exploit the secret weaknesses of monsters.

Anointed Blade

2nd-Level Salbenist Feature

You can perform an anointing ritual over the course of 1 hour with a weapon you are proficient with and that lacks the twohanded property. During the ritual, you must coat the weapon with an oil, which is absorbed into the weapon and anoints it. Upon concluding the ritual, you gain the following benefits until you perform the anointing ritual on another weapon:

• When you attack with the anointed weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.

• When you equip the anointed weapon, you can will the oil absorbed into it to coat it. Doing so does not consume the oil, and the weapon remains coated until you dismiss it, it leaves your hand, or until you coat it with another oil.

• Whenever you make a damage roll for additional damage dealt with an oil and roll the highest value on one of the damage dice, you can roll that die one additional time and add the number rolled to the damage.

Extra Attack

6th-Level Salbenist Feature

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

All-Consuming Flame

10th-Level Salbenist Feature

When you take damage of the same type dealt by the oil anointing your weapon, you can use a reaction to reduce the damage you take to 0. When you do, you regain a number of hit points equal to the total damage reduced. If these hit points would exceed your hit point maximum, you can choose to instead gain the remainder as temporary hit points.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

Soul of Cinder

14th-Level Salbenist Feature

Whenever you make a damage roll for additional damage dealt with an oil and roll the highest value on any of the dice, the attack’s damage ignores resistance and immunity.

Toxicologist

A reviled trade in most societies, toxicologists are alchemists that specialize in disease and poison. Other practices tend to view the toxicologist as a perversion of a sacred art, leading them to more often find a home within a thieves’ guild, supplying black markets with these insidious concoctions. They are a logistical keystone in the planning of assassinations requiring a more delicate touch, but some toxicologists are less secretive about their trade. There are adventurers that may break away from the traditional view of their title; a paladin may break their oath, or a cleric may worship a god of death. For alchemists, it’s the incorporation of poison in their sacred study they view as a foul practice that lingers in the shadow.

Fel Theory

2nd-Level Toxicologist Feature

When you create an alchemical item that inflicts the poisoned condition or deals poison or necrotic damage, you can infuse the item with specific materials to enhance it. The material must have a value of at least 5 gp and for each additional material you use, the item gains the corresponding effect:

Desecrated Water. Any poison damage dealt by the item becomes necrotic damage.

Eye of Newt. While the target is poisoned in this way, the target takes 1d6 poison damage the first time it is hit with an attack on a turn.

Powdered Lead & a Flask. The poison becomes a toxic powder or gas that takes effect when inhaled, rather than its indicated method of subjecting a creature to its effects. As an action, you open or throw the flask to a point up to 20 feet away, shattering the flask. Creatures within 5 feet of the point are subjected to the poison.

Valerian Root. While the target is poisoned in this way, the target’s mind wracks with pain. Whenever the creature makes a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, it must subtract a d4 from the number rolled for the check.

Mithridatism

6th-Level Toxicologist Feature

You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the poisoned condition on yourself. You also have resistance to poison damage. Additionally, if another feature, item, or spell gives you resistance to poison damage, you can choose instead to gain one of the following benefits, which lasts for the duration listed in the effect (you choose when the effect takes place):

• You are immune to poison damage.

• You have resistance to acid damage.

• You have resistance to necrotic damage.

The alchemical poisons you create have the potential to overcome natural defenses against them. Poisons you create have the following changes:

• They ignore resistance to poison damage.

• A creature that has immunity to poison damage instead takes half damage from the item instead of none.

• They ignore immunity to the poisoned condition, with these creatures instead making the saving throw with advantage.
