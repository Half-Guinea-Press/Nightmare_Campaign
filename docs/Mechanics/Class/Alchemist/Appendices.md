Design Notes

Item Rewrites

Some alchemical items received revisions to help with their mechanics in play. There’s been a debate online about how these items are intended to be used, without clear ruling having been given by Wizards of the Coast.

Use an Object

You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.

For those unfamiliar with the problem; Acid, Alchemist’s Fire, and Holy Water were all written essentially as follows:

Alchemical Item. As an action, you can splash the contents of this container onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the item as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is subjected to the item’s effects.

This wording can be a bit unclear or potentially bring up issues for a few reasons. This isn’t to say these are intended for the mechanic, just the logic that leads to misinterpretations:

• The addition of “make a ranged attack” in the item’s description could be interpreted to mean your Dexterity modifier is added to, at the very least, the first damage roll of the item. Despite him saying not to take his Tweets at face value, Jeremy Crawford has stated this was how the item is intended to work, although it’s worth mentioning here that I disagree with the Dexterity modifier adding to the subsequent rolls of alchemist’s fire.

• The mechanics for Improvised Weapons imply that an improvised weapon attack can be made with any object using the Attack action. The addition of “improvised weapon” in the item’s description and the fact that an alchemical item within a vial doesn’t shatter by, effectively, performing the same actions in the narrative is counter-intuitive and seems to only be put in place to prevent martialists from using more than one of these items at a time.

• The item itself does not specifically state if the use includes the damage of an improvised weapon. That’s before even talking about the “Net Problem”, wherein an item or weapon that calls for a ranged attack against a creature within 5 feet of you is always made with disadvantage.

Improvised Weapons

Player’s Handbook pp. 147-148

Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin. Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM’s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals ld4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals ld4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

Attack for Alchemical Item

This interaction would cause the item to deal 1d4 + Dexterity modifier damage when used as a ranged improvised weapon, but the judgment on whether or not this specific interaction would cause the item to work would point towards “no”, which is just bad narrative conveyance. Use Object for Alchemical Item

This appears to be the intended action to use for alchemical items, with the interaction itself simply lifting the clause for improvised weapons. The murkiness happens when you look at the text for improvised weapons, which states that in doing so it deals 1d4 damage of a type appropriate for the item, with nothing in either the item or Improvised Weapon wording clarifying whether or not this additional damage applies to the damage dealt in the item’s description.

The Fix

Moving alchemical items away from the Use an Object action and over towards the Attack action actually updates the Player’s Handbook to be consistent with the mechanics for alchemical items in later books. Remove Improvised from Alchemical Items. This “coding” for the items only exists in the Player’s Handbook. Attack or Use an Object. Allowing the item to be used with the Attack action or Use an Object enhances narrative cohession

FAQ

Question: Can I create alchemical items from the alchemist class as a downtime activity that are permanent?

Answer: Yes. This is a thing you could already do within the offi - cial rules. The alchemist can just do it more efficiently through their Experimentalist Adept feature.

Question: What do the crafting rules mean by gold required if crafting requires materials to craft the item?

Answer: The Cost indicated in the Player’s Handbook and simi - lar materials list the “market value” of the item. This has been used in the Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Masters Guide, and a few other official books. When you craft an item, the term “raw materials” is used to refer to essentially “anything re - quired to make the item (DM’s discretion)”. This supplement adopts this and is designed to embrace it rather than override the base crafting system.

Question: So I don’t have to spend gold to craft?

Answer: No. The gold called for is the market value of the item. In the case of single-use items (such as most alchemical items and consumable potions), you divide the market value in half to get you the cost of raw materials required to create the item. You may have to spend gold to gather raw materials, but this supple - ment provides a variant rule for gathering them whole foraging.

Question: Does the new wording for Alchemical Items cause them to interact with Archery & Sharpshooter?

Answer: Here’s the thing; they already did. It seems to me that there’s a belief that they shouldn’t, so if you’re not comfortable with this interaction, I would suggest a rule that those features only work with bows and crossbows.

Question: Why can’t we make this character in the base game?

Answer: I feel that the Artificer Alchemist isn’t a great repre - sentation of the traditional archetype of an alchemist. The tie-in with the Artificer seems to inject a certain flavor on the character option that had turned me away from it.

• Underserved/Restrictive Crafting Rules: The rules for craft - ing in 5e essentially gate martial crafters out of reasonable combat effectiveness.

• Object Permanence: When you create a potion, you would like for it to remain permanently until used. However, this causes issues with what I call “Batman Prep.” Batman prep means that, if allowed the time and resources, a character can do something that makes them effectively unstoppable in any situation. Potions of healing last indefinitely, which means that’s a narrative expectation we should be aiming to design for.

• Ignorance of Encumbrance: The most common houserule out of any houserule is that players are likely allowed to ignore what’s in their pack (within reason). We cannot bal - ance around encumbrance in 5e because items like the bag of holding exist and are basically expected for a party to have before 5th level.

• Value over Interaction: The general rules for collecting materials that would be used in creating potions is mostly limited in description to “gp value” rather than a hard-set material narrative.
