# Downtime

This chapter is a reorganization of the information already provided across the official books for clear, concise reference and ruling. The Alchemist and the items within were created to embrace the 5e crafting system rather than rewrite it, but these rules are somewhat scattered across the Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Masters Guide, and Xanathar’s Guide to Everything. Some of the rules that do not pertain to the alchemist’s class features have been omitted.

The footnotes within also address some questions that came up during playtest that felt necessary to highlight what rules class features may apply to.

Activities

Downtime activities require a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.

Crafting

Xanathar’s Guide to Everything pp. 128-130

You can craft nonmagical objects using a tool you are proficient with. You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with alchemist’s supplies needs a laboratory in order to craft a tanglefoot bag or acid.

For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value.7 8

If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5-gp 7 This is what Experimentalist Adept was designed to enhance; making it more efficient for the alchemist to create the items they need for adventures. 8 "Raw Materials" is the term used in the official books to refer to any materials required to create the item. You do not need to provide gold pieces to create an item, you just need to purchase materials if you are not able to source them. increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.

While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5 for more information on lifestyle expenses).

Crafting an Item

A character who has the time, the money, and the needed tools can use downtime to craft armor, weapons, clothing, or other kinds of nonmagical gear.

Resources and Resolution. In addition to the appropriate tools for the item to be crafted, a character needs raw materials worth half of the item’s selling cost. To determine how many workweeks it takes to create an item, divide its gold piece cost by 50. A character can complete multiple items in a workweek if the items’ combined cost is 50 gp or lower. Items that cost more than 50 gp can be completed over longer periods of time, as long as the work in progress is stored in a safe location. Multiple characters can combine their efforts. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Use your judgment when determining how many characters can collaborate on an item. If all the above requirements are met, the result of the process is an item of the desired sort. A character can sell an item crafted in this way at its listed price.9

Crafting a Magic Item

Dungeon Master’s Guide pp. 128-129

Magic items are the DM’s purview, so you decide how they fall into the party’s possession. As an option, you can allow player characters to craft magic items.

The creation of a magic item is a lengthy, expensive task. To start, a character must have a formula that describes the construction of the item. The character must also be a spellcaster with spell slots and must be able to cast any spells that the item can produce. Moreover, the character must meet a level minimum determined by the item’s rarity, as shown in the

Crafting Magic Items table. For example, a 3rd-level character could create a wand of magic missiles (an uncommon item), as long as the character has spell slots and can cast magic missile. That same character could make a +1 weapon (another uncommon item), no particular spell required. 9 Note, this last sentence uses "can" in an odd way that may imply the character always gets market value if they sell an item. This would be a removal of DM agency that is very atypical of 5e rules wording, so I assume this was unintended You can decide that certain items also require special materials or locations to be created. For example, a character might need alchemist’s supplies to brew a particular potion, or the formula for a flame tongue might require that the weapon be forged with lava.

Crafting Magic Items

Item Rarity Creation Cost Minimum Level

Common 100 gp 3rd

Uncommon 500 gp 3rd

Rare 5,000 gp 6th

Very Rare 50,000 gp 11th

Legendary 500,000 gp 17th

An item has a creation cost specified in the Crafting Magic Items table (half that cost for a consumable, such as a potion or scroll). A character engaged in the crafting of a magic item makes progress in 25 gp increments, spending that amount for each day of work until the total cost is paid. The character is assumed to work for 8 hours each of those days. Thus, creating an uncommon magic item takes 20 days and 500 gp. You are free to adjust the costs to better suit your campaign.

If a spell will be produced by the item being created, the creator must expend one spell slot of the spell’s level for each day of the creation process. The spell’s material components must also be at hand throughout the process. If the spell normally consumes those components, they are consumed by the creation process. If the item will be able to produce the spell only once, as with a spell scroll, the components are consumed only once by the process. Otherwise, the components are consumed once each day of the item’s creation.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts to create a magic item if each of them meets the level prerequisite. Each character can contribute spells, spell slots, and components, as long as everyone participates during the entire crafting process. Each character can contribute 25 gp worth of effort for each day spent helping to craft the item.

Normally, a character who undertakes this activity creates a magic item described in chapter 7, “Treasure.” At your discretion, you can allow players to design their own magic items, using the guidelines in chapter 9, “Dungeon Master’s Workshop.” While crafting a magic item, a character can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay the 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5, “Equipment,” in the Player’s Handbook).

Magic Item Formulas

Dungeon Master’s Guide p. 141

A magic item formula explains how to make a particular magic item. Such a formula can be an excellent reward if you allow player characters to craft magic items.

You can award a formula in place of a magic item. Usually written in a book or on a scroll, a formula is one step rarer than the item it allows a character to create. For example, the formula for a common magic item is uncommon. No formulas exist for legendary items. If the creation of magic items is commonplace in your campaign, a formula can have a rarity that matches the rarity of the item it allows a character to create. Formulas for common and uncommon items might even be for sale, each with a cost double that of its magic item.

Brewing Potions of Healing

Potions of healing fall into a special category for item crafting, separate from other magic items. A character who has proficiency with the herbalism kit can create these potions. The times and costs for doing so are summarized on the Potion of Healing Creation table.

Potions of Healing Creation

Type Item Cost –Crafting Cost–

Time Cost

Healing 50 gp 1 day 25 gp

Greater 200 gp 1 wk 100 gp

Superior 2,000 gp 3 wks 1,000 gp

Supreme 20,000 gp 4 wks 10,000 gp

Foraging

An alchemist in need can resource the raw materials for their alchemical items from the surrounding environment. Should this come up in your games, the following variant rule has been provided.

Variant Rule: Foraging Raw Materials

Just as characters can gather food and water while traveling at a normal or slow pace, a foraging character can spend time gathering raw materials for crafting. When doing so, the character can make either an Intelligence (Nature) or a Wisdom (Survival) check after spending 1 hour foraging, with the DC determined by the abundance of resources in the region.

Raw Material Foraging

Resource Availability DC

Abundant 10

Limited 15

Scarce 20

If multiple characters forage, each character makes a separate check. A foraging character finds nothing on a failed check. On a successful check, roll 1d6 + the ability modifier used to determine the value of the raw materials (in gp) the character finds.
