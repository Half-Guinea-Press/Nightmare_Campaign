Evasion. If the homunculus is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails. It can’t use this trait if it’s incapacitated.

Telepathic Bond. While the homunculus is on the same plane of existence as you, it can magically convey what it senses to you, and you can communicate telepathically with each other.

Actions

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +2 plus PB to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your alchemy save DC or be poisoned for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target falls unconscious, or until it takes damage or another creature uses an action to shake it awake.
