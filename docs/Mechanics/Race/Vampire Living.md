# Vampire, Living

The vampires arose in the Ostoyan Empire after the Burach Empire invaded, slaughtering the people. The blood flowed deep into the earth and caused the cursed city to be exposed to the surface. The vampires then took over all the Ostoyan nobles and now lead the kingdom pushing the Burach Empire.

## Racial Features

### Living Dead: You count as humanoid, yet register as undead to spells and other effects that react to undead creature type

### Superior Darkvision: You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light and darkness as if it were dim light.

### Shadow Prowler: Perception and Stealth are skills

### Sanguin Curse:

- You have resistance to Necrotic damage and Immunity to Bleeding, Disease, and Poison effects
- You may spend up to your proficiency modifier Hit Dice to heal as a reaction.
- You gain an additional three death saves for a total of six. The final (6th) is an automatic success, unless you were dealt damage from silver, holy (radiant), or daylight, but you enter a torpor for at least one month (the new moon). You can awaken from this torpor only if - You are fed enough vampire blood (hit dice) to awaken you (seven plus one per month in torpor)
- A living creature with blood comes within 30â€™ of you. You will awaken, ravenous and do anything to feed until you have sated your thirst of Hit Dice equal to seven plus one per month (new moon) in torpor.

### Fangs & Claws: you may make an attack with applying either Dex or Str and deal (piercing or slashing respectfully) 1d6 + Con mod damage and inflict Blood Drain with a bite (see below) or Bleeding effect from a claw attack.

### Blood Drain: With a successful bite attack you may choose to drink your victims blood, if they have any. You can consume up to your proficiency modifier the victims Hit Dice and use them to restore your own Hit Dice pool. Once you are filled you may not drain any more.

### Sunlight Sensitivity: You have disadvantage on attack and Perception checks that rely on sight when you, the target, or whatever you are trying to interact with is in direct sunlight.

## Vampiric Weaknesses:

- You do not recover your Hit Dice naturally but must feed on others to restore them. You also expend Hit Dice equal to your Proficiency modifier each week for sustenance.
- You gain the Poisoned condition if you are exposed to Silver or Garlic.

- You gain the Decaying condition if you are exposed to Daylight or Running water.

### Bleeding

Condition does 1d4 damage at the end of each turn, that ignore temporary hit points until you are healed with magic or someone performs a DC 15 medicine check, bleeding only applies to creatures that have blood.

### Decaying

Condition that causes a creature to rot away as though it were dead. The decaying condition is measured in six levels. IF an already decaying creature suffers another effect that causes decaing, its current level of decaying increases by the amount spceified in the effect's description. A creature suffers the effect of its current level of decaying as well as all lower levels. When an affected creature finishes a long rest outside of the domain, its level of decaying is reduced by one. Other methods of removing decaying are believed to exist though the existence and nature of such is determined by the GM.
