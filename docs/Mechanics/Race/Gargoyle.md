# Gargoyle

The spread of mankind destroyed most of the races in the world. As protectors the gargoyles found themselves besieged and fled the lands tainted by the march of mankind. With the rise of Ostoyan vampires they found the need for guardians; they found the last of the gargoyle tribes. The vampires gave them a home and the gargoyles were once again able to fulfill the Vow.
