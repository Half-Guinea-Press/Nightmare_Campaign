# Fettered

The Fettered are an attempt by the Geist Geniocracy to enable Geist’s to interact with the mortal world outside of the Manifest zone. Utilizing materials that react to ectoplasm and some of the complex clockwork they have constructed some mobile shells. These shells were successful and it was discovered that the method to compress the Geist and its ectoplasm provides it ability to illuminate allies and provide them with enhanced assistance.

### Geneva Drive: 

Fettered have an oscillator somewhere on its body that it cannot reach. The oscillator determines whether the Fettered is a creature or an object. If the oscillator is ignited, the Fettered counts as a creature and uses its normal statistics. If the oscillator isn’t ignited, the Fettered counts as an object and it becomes incapacitated; pylons open from the body exposing the corpse light lantern holding the Fettered’s spirit. Any damage taken in excess of the Health of the Fettered creature form applies to its Health in object form; if the clockwork takes damage equal to the Health of its object form, it is destroyed.

- Resilience: The object form will have an 15 AC and 50 HP<br>
- Immune damage from disease and poison: attack rolls against Intellect, Will, or Perception; attacks that can be resisted with Intellect, Will, or Perception challenge rolls; afflictions (see Suppressed Afflictions)<br>
- Suppressed Afflictions: Any existing afflictions in the clockwork’s creature form are suppressed and have no effect for as long as the clockwork remains an object. However, rounds spent in object form count toward the duration of those afflictions.<br>
- Object: The clockwork cannot use actions or triggered actions. It cannot move and is completely insensate.<br>
- Failing Magic: If the clockwork became an object as a result of being incapacitated, the magic binding the soul to its body begins to fail. At the end of each round, roll a d6.<br>

 6: The clockwork arrests the failing magic and is no longer incapacitated, though it remains an object until another creature uses an action to ignite its oscillator.<br>
2–5: The magic fails. If the clockwork gets this result three times, its soul escapes the body and it remains an object permanently.<br>
1: The clockwork explodes into a sphere with a radius of 1d6 yards centered on a point in its space. The clockwork is destroyed and everything in the area takes 2d6 damage. A creature in the area can make an Agility challenge roll, taking half the damage on a success.

- Ignition: While the clockwork is an object, any creature that can reach it can use an action to twist the key. If the clockwork is not incapacitated, its mechanisms start working again and it becomes a creature at the end of the round. If the clockwork was incapacitated, roll a d6. On a 3 or lower, it remains incapacitated. On a 4 or higher, it heals 1 damage and becomes a creature at the end of the round.<br>
- Repair Damage: A creature can use a tool kit and an action to start repairing a Fettered in its object form. If the creature spends a total of 4 hours working, it can make an Intellect challenge roll with disadvantage. On a success, the object form heals 1d6 + 1 damage.
