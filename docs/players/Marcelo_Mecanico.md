You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.<br>- The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.<br>- A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.<br>The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.<br>You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time.
