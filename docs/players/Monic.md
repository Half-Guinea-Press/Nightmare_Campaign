=== "Features"

    Gargoyle: Medium Construct<br>
    Darkvision :material-information-outline:{ title="You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray." }<br>
    False Statue :material-information-outline:{ title="As an action, you can remain motionless, becoming indistinguishable from an inanimate statue.<br>- You have immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage unless from Cold-Iron or Adamantine.<br>You have resistance against spells and magic effects damage.<br>You have advantage on saving throws against spells and magic effects.<br>You expend up to your proficiency modifier in Hit Dice to heal each round.<br>You gain an additional three death saves for a total of six. The final (6th) is an automatic success, unless you were dealt damage from Cold-Iron or Adamantine, but you enter and are unable to leave statue state for at least one month (the full moon). You can awaken from this torpor only if.<br>You naturally recover your hit points to maximum while in the statue state.<br>Someone that knows your true-name touches you and asks you to awaken to fulfill your vow and shed their blood (one hit die per remaining death save to heal).<br>While you are locked in this state, your speed is 0, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and the only action you can take is to leave this state as a reaction or bonus action." }<br>
    Living Construct :material-information-outline:{ title="Even though you are made of stone, you are a living creature.<br>You have advantage on saving throws against poison conditions, you have resistance against poison damage, and you are immune to diseases.<br>You do not need to eat, drink or breathe.<br>Instead of sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 4 hours each day. You do not dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal." }<br>
    Natural Armor :material-information-outline:{ title="When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 11 + your Constitution modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor." }<br>
    Fangs & Claws :material-information-outline:{ title="You may make an attack with applying either Dex or Str and deal (piercing or slashing respectfully) 1d6 + Con mod damage." }<br>
    The Watch :material-information-outline:{ title="Your dedication as a guardian provides you the following.<br>You can add your proficiency die to one attack roll, ability or skill check, or saving throw you make, and you can do so after seeing the d20 roll but before the effects of the roll are resolved. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.<br>You gain proficiency in perception and insight" }<br>
